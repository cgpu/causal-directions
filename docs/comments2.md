Dear Editor

We are very grateful for the attention you have given to our manuscript. The reviewer comments have helped us make it a much clearer paper and we have found them to be very constructive and valuable. We have now revised the manuscript to address the specific comments below (our comments in **bold**).

Best wishes

Gibran Hemani, Kate Tilling, George Davey Smith

## Reviewer #1:

Methods

1. First paragraph of Methods: The descriptions of the component CIT tests 1 and 3 are not accurate. The conditional nature of the tests are not described.

    **Thank you for pointing this out, we have now reworded this section and included the correct test formulations.**

2. It is not clear why CIT(x->y) < alpha and CIT(y->x) < alpha would imply (x <- u -> y) [also, u is introduced without definition here].

    **We failed to make this clear, and have now added a supplementary figure that shows this result.**

3. Figure 3. The y-axis title “False Positive Rate” is confusing for the upper panel labeled “Power” on the right.

    **Thank you, the axis label and figure legend have been reworded for clarity now.**

## Reviewer #2:

The authors have responded adequately to my previous comments. There now just remain a few typos for correction:

1. Page 9 line 4: should there be an "=" sign between $\rho_{y,y_0}$ and "1" ?

    **Thank you, this has been corrected**

2. Page 15: Remove "False" from y axis legend on the left (since the top plots show the true positive rate, not the false positive rate). Remove "True" from Figure 3 legend (since the bottom plots show false positive rates, not true positive rates).

    **Thank you, this has been corrected.**

3. Page 16: Replace the word "red" with "black" wherever it appears in the Figure 4 legend, since you appear to be using a black plane/surface, not a red one.

    **Thank you for this, corrected.**
